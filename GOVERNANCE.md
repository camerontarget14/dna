# DNA Project Governance

DNA is a project of the Academy Software Foundation and relies on the ASWF governance policies, supported by the Linux Foundation.

DNA aims to be governed in a transparent, accessible way for the benefit of the community. All participation in this project is open and not bound to corporate affiliation. Participants are bound to the project's [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

The project is structured around a Technical Steering Committee (TSC) which has the final authority on the decisions around the project. Reponsibilities of the TSC include but not limited to:

* Management of the project GitHub repository and associated logistics.
* Technical oversight and decision making regarding DNA's implementation.
* Managing communications and marketing regarding the project.

The TSC will meet at a cadence deemed appropriate by the TSC committee. The TSC meeting agenda will be shared with all appointed roles and on the DNA slack channel at least 1 day before the TSC meeting.

See [ASWF TSC FAQ](https://tac.aswf.io/process/tsc_faq.html) for more details.

# Decision Making

DNA will operate primarily through consensus and discussion against agenda items raised by the TSC members in the TSC meetings, if consensus is not easily achieved, decisions will go to a vote of at least 80% of TSC voting members with a simple majority to decide the resolution.

# Project roles

## Chairperson

The chairperson is a nominateable role within DNA and is resposible for the following:
* Lead and orchestrate TSC meetings - setting agenda with consultation of other TSC members.
* Be the public spokesperson for the project.
* Ensure the project meets the charter aims.

## TAC Representative

The TSC will elect a TAC Representative who will be the primary point of contact for the project to the TAC upon becoming an Active stage project.

## TSC Member

A TSC member is an appointed role within DNA that holds voting rights. Members will have a mix of technical and advisory responsiblities and are expected to participate in some or all of the following:
* Hold a key position in deciding and contributing to the direction of DNA.
* Attend TSC meetings and contribute to discussions, technical decisions, and any decisions requiring a vote.
* Provide documentation and insights to requirements during TSC discussions.
* Improve specification and documentation of DNA.
* Direct contributions to the DNA codebase.
* Review contributor pull requests and manage merges to the trunk.
* Provide guidance on the deployment of DNA within organisations.
* Test and provide feedback on DNA.

## Committer

Committer is an appointed role within DNA holding write access to the code repo which grants them responsibility for accepting reviewed code changes and triggering merges. Committers are typically the set of TSC members who are senior developers with a proven history on the project (not solely on the TSC for advisory purposes) and being granted Committer status often confers TSC membership and vice-versa, but not always. If a TSC member serves in a mainly advisory role they may not assume Committer rights. And in circumstances where the addition of more TSC members from a given company may tilt the voting balance in an unintended way, someone may be granted Committer rights but not become a voting membership of the TSC.

In order to maintain security of the project (under the principle of "least necessary privilege") Committers who are no longer sufficiently active in the project can have their status and rights revoked at the discretion of the TSC.

## Contributor

The Contributor is an open initial role for anyone participating in the project and wishing to contribute code.

### Process for becoming a Contributor

* Review the [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md) guidelines to ensure your contribution is inline with the project's coding and styling guidelines.
* Submit your code as a PR with the appropriate DCO sign-off.
* Have your submission approved by a TSC Member and merged into the codebase.

# Release Process

Project releases will occur on a scheduled basis as agreed to by the TSC.

# Conflict resolution and voting

In general, we prefer that issues, technical and otherwise, are amicably worked out
between the persons involved. If a dispute cannot be decided independently, the TSC can be
called in to decide an issue. If the TSC themselves cannot decide an issue, the issue will
be resolved by voting (see "Decision Making" above).

# Communication

This project, just like all of open source, is a global community. In addition to the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), this project will:
* Keep all communication on open channels (mailing list, forums, chat).
* Be respectful of time and language differences between community members (such as scheduling meetings, email/issue responsiveness, etc).
* Ensure tools are able to be used by community members regardless of their region.

If you have concerns about communication challenges for this project, please contact the TSC.

# Process for role transitions

If a person holding an appointed role - suitable notice must be given when stepping down and a replacement (if required) will be proposed for inclusion by vote during the next TSC meeting. If an appointed role has not been active and remains out of contact for a period deemed appropriate by the TSC members and - then that role will be put up for nomination by the commitee.
